# Covid-19
Used Covid-19 dataset for Data Manipulation and Data Visualization
Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

Solved the following queries:

Select Data that we are going to be starting with
Total Cases vs Total Deaths (Shows likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country)
Total Cases vs Population (Shows what percentage of population infected with Covid)
Countries with Highest Infection Rate wrt Population
Countries with Highest Infection Rate wrt Population (by location)
Countries with Highest Infection Rate wrt Population (by income status)
Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
Showing contintents with the highest death count per population
Global Numbers
Total Population vs Vaccinations (Shows Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine)
Using CTE to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query
Using Temp Table to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query
Creating View to store data for later visualizations in tableau

Demonstration of percentage of population Infected per Country
