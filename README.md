Used Covid-19 dataset for Data Manipulation and Data Visualization

Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

Solved the following queries:

1.Select Data that we are going to be starting with

2.Total Cases vs Total Deaths (Shows likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country)

3.Total Cases vs Population (Shows what percentage of population infected with Covid)

8.Showing contintents with the highest death count per population

9.Global Numbers

10.Total Population vs Vaccinations (Shows Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine)

11.Using CTE to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query

12.Using Temp Table to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query

13.Creating View to store data for later visualizations in tableau

14.Demonstration of percentage of population Infected per Country
